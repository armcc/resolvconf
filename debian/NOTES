                     MAINTAINER NOTES
                     for resolvconf

TODO
----
* File bug reports against all suppliers of nameserver information
  asking each to add a packaging-event hook script, analogous to 
  #628003 (dnsmasq) and #628846 (pdnsd).

piuparts
--------
* Reports:

    invoke-rc.d: policy-rc.d denied execution of enable-updates

  and ditto for "disable-updates" but this is because the chroot includes
  a policy-rc.d that denies all requests.

* Reports:

    ERROR: FAIL: After purging files have been modified:
      /etc/resolv.conf	 not owned

  but this is not a bug, since resolvconf can justifiably modify
  that file, which isn't an ordinary configuration file.

Loop dangers
------------
Remember the interesting fact that postinst runs dpkg-event.d/foo
which probably runs /sbin/resolvconf which probably runs update.d/foo.

Things one tends to forget
--------------------------
Remember to run debconf-updatepo after changing a template or po file.
