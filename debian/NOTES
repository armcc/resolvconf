This is not a problem.  These dirs will disappear on boot.


Loop dangers
------------
Remember the interesting fact that postinst runs dpkg-event.d/foo
which probably runs /sbin/resolvconf which probably runs update.d/foo.

Things one tends to forget
--------------------------
Remember to run debconf-updatepo after changing templates or po files.
