resolvconf (1.70) unstable; urgency=low

  The resolvconf update script for BIND 8 has been disabled.

  Until Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) the resolvconf package included an
  update script /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind which generated the file
  /var/run/bind/named.options from /etc/bind/named.conf.options such
  that name server addresses from resolvconf's database were inserted
  into the forwarders{} statement inside the options{} statement. If
  configured to read this file, BIND 8's named would thus use name
  server addresses registered with resolvconf as forwarder addresses.
  The necessary manual configuration steps were described in the
  resolvconf package README file.

  The script was written for BIND 8. BIND 8 was removed from Debian in
  Debian 5.0 (Lenny) and the script in question was dropped from the
  resolvconf package in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy), but was not deleted from
  the filesystem at that time unless the resolvconf package was purged.
  Hence, on machines on which earlier versions of resolvconf had been
  installed the script was still present. In Debian 8.0 (Jessie) the
  script is deactivated by renaming it to "bind.dpkg-old". See Debian
  bug report #687507.

  BIND 9 has replaced BIND 8. It is proposed that an update script,
  to be named "/etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind9", be included in the
  bind9 package which provides the same benefits as the old script.
  Anyone who would like to have this feature is encouraged to add
  their voice either to Debian bug report #483098 or to Ubuntu bug
  report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/1091602.

  If you were still using the old update script and want to re-enable
  it then do the following.

      cd /etc/resolvconf/update.d && sudo mv bind.dpkg-old mybind
