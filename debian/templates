_Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
 The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for
 dynamic updating of the resolver configuration file. Part of the
 necessary infrastructure is a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to
 /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this
 link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be
 preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be
 restored if this package is removed.
 .
 Declining this option will prevent future installations from
 recreating the symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration
 file will not be dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be
 activated following instructions in the README file.
 .
 The presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs,
 so it should not be left installed if unconfigured.

Template: resolvconf/downup-interfaces
Type: note
_Description: Reboot recommended
 Local caching name servers and interface configurers supply name
 server information to resolvconf after resolvconf has been
 installed. Name servers that previously started, and configurers
 that previously brought up interfaces, have not supplied their
 name server information to resolvconf. The information has usually
 either been lost or has been added directly to /etc/resolv.conf.
 In order to preserve as much information as possible, resolvconf
 includes the contents of the original /etc/resolv.conf in its
 database until reboot. Although resolvconf attempts to trigger other
 programs to send their information to resolvconf after installation,
 this often does not happen correctly. Consequently, in order for
 resolvconf's name server information to be fully correct it is often
 necessary to reboot the system.

Template: resolvconf/link-tail-to-original
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
 If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)
 contains name server addresses, those addresses should be listed on
 "dns-nameservers" lines in /etc/network/interfaces. For more
 information, please consult the resolvconf(8) man page and the
 README file.
 .
 Until /etc/network/interfaces has been edited and the affected
 interfaces brought down and up again, the name server addresses will
 not be included in the dynamically generated resolver configuration
 file.
 .
 If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in
 place: a symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist)
 from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
 /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. This will cause the whole of
 that original resolver configuration file to be appended to the
 dynamically generated file.
 .
 After the required "dns-nameservers" lines have been added to
 /etc/network/interfaces, the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail link
 should be replaced by one to /dev/null.
