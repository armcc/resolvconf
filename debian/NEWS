resolvconf (1.70) unstable; urgency=low

  In Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) the resolvconf package included a resolvconf
  update script named "bind" which copied /etc/bind/named.conf.options
  to /var/run/bind/named.options while overwriting the forwarders{}
  statement to list addresses from resolvconf's database. BIND 8's
  named could thus use nameserver addresses known to resolvconf as
  forwarder addresses, provided some further manual configuration was
  done so that named would read the dynamically written options file.
  The manual configuration steps were described in the README file.

  The script was written for BIND 8. After the removal of BIND 8 from
  the Debian archive the script in question was dropped from the 
  resolvconf package, in version 1.53 and thus in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy),
  but not deleted from the filesystem unless the resolvconf package
  was purged. Thus, machines on which earlier versions of resolvconf
  had been installed continued to have the script.
  
  As of resolvconf 1.69 and thus in Debian 8.0 (Jessie), the script is
  deactivated by renaming it to "bind.dpkg-old". See Debian bug report
  #687507.

  BIND 9 has replaced BIND 8. The same old script could be used with
  BIND 9 but, due to enhancements in BIND 9, a better, safer script
  named "bind9" can be written. Such a script should, moreover, be
  included in the bind9 package and not in resolvconf. This has been
  requested in Debian bug report #483098 and in Ubuntu bug LP#1091602
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/1091602).
  Anyone who would like to have this feature is invited to add their
  voice to one of the aforementioned bug reports.
