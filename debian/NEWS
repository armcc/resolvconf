resolvconf (1.70) unstable; urgency=low

  The resolvconf update script for BIND 8 has been disabled.

  Until Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) the resolvconf package included an
  update script /etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind which generated the file
  /var/run/bind/named.options from /etc/bind/named.conf.options such
  that name server addresses from resolvconf's database were inserted
  in the forwarders{} statement inside the options{} statement. If
  configured to read this file, BIND 8's named would thus use name
  server addresses registered with resolvconf as forwarder addresses.
  The necessary manual configuration steps were described in the
  resolvconf package README file.

  The script was written for BIND 8. BIND 8 was removed from Debian in
  Debian 5.0 (Lenny) and the script in question was dropped from the
  resolvconf package in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy), but was not deleted from
  the filesystem unless the resolvconf package was purged. Hence,
  machines on which earlier versions of resolvconf had been installed
  continued to have the script. In Debian 8.0 (Jessie) the script is
  deactivated by renaming it to "bind.dpkg-old". See Debian bug report
  #687507.

  BIND 9 has replaced BIND 8. It would be possible to write a similar
  update script for BIND 9, named "/etc/resolvconf/update.d/bind9",
  and include this in the bind9 package. This has been requested in
  Debian bug report #483098 and also in Ubuntu bug LP#1091602
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/1091602).
  Anyone who would like to have this feature is encouraged to add
  their voice to one of the aforementioned bug reports.

  If you were still using the old update script and want to re-enable
  it then do the following.

      cd /etc/resolvconf/update.d && sudo mv bind.dpkg-old mybind
