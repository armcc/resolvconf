                     MAINTAINER NOTES
                     for resolvconf

TODO
----
* Add a Systemd unit file  obeying the dictates of policy ยง9.11.

* File bug reports against all packages containing suppliers of nameserver
  information, asking each to add a resolvconf packaging-event hook script.

  To be submitted:
  * (nameservers:) pdns-recursor, totd
    + Easy to implement: just call initscript or add 127.0.0.1.
  * (DHCP clients:) isc-dhcp-client, dhcpcd, pump, udhcpc
    + Probably easiest and best to trigger DHCP lease renewals.

  Already submitted:
  * #628003, #641717 dnsmasq [both DONE]
  * #628846 pdnsd
  * #641714 bind9
  * #639803 network-manager

awk
---
We mustn't use awk in any runtime code but we may use it in the
maintainer scripts where convenient.

piuparts
--------
* Reports:

    ERROR: FAIL: After purging files have been modified:
      /etc/resolv.conf	 not owned

  but this is not a bug, since resolvconf can justifiably modify
  that file, which isn't an ordinary configuration file.


Things to remember
------------------
Remember to run debconf-updatepo after changing a template or po file.

When changing the interface-order file, remember also to change the
patterns in bin/list-records.

When changing the normalize_stdin function, remember also to update it
in debian/test-normalization.


Loop dangers
------------
Remember the interesting fact that postinst runs dpkg-event.d/foo
which probably runs /sbin/resolvconf which probably runs update.d/foo.
