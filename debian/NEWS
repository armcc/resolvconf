resolvconf (1.46~2) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the future the dhclient program will be shipped not in the
    dhcp3-client package but in the isc-dhcp-client package.

    The latter version of dhclient reads its configuration from
    /etc/dhcp/ rather than from /etc/dhcp3/.

    Accordingly this version of resolvconf contains a new hook script
    /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf which has the same
    contents as /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf.

    If you have made local changes to
    /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf and you plan to use
    the isc-dhcp-client package then you should make the same changes
    to /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf.
