"This package contains the infrastructure required for dynamic updating of "
"the resolver configuration file. Part of the necessary infrastructure is a "
"symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf. If "
"you agree then this link will be created. The existing /etc/resolv.conf file "
"will be preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original; it will be "
"restored if this package is removed."

"If you do not agree then the necessary symbolic link will not be created and "
"consequently your resolver configuration file will not be dynamically "
"updated. In order to activate dynamic updating you will have to configure "
"resolvconf manually following the straightforward instructions in the README "
"file. If you choose not to configure resolvconf at all then you should "
"remove the package because its presence causes some programs to deviate from "
"their default behavior."

"Once resolvconf is installed, interface configurers supply nameserver "
"information to it (which it then makes available to the C Library resolver "
"and to DNS caches). However, they do this only when they bring up "
"interfaces. Therefore for resolvconf's nameserver information to be up to "
"date after initial installation it is necessary to reconfigure interfaces -- "
"that is, to take them down and then to bring them up again -- and to restart "
"DNS caches."

"If your original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf) "
"contains nameserver addresses then those addresses should be listed on \"dns-"
"nameservers\" lines in /etc/network/interfaces as described in the README. "
"Until you have modified /etc/network/interfaces and reconfigured the "
"affected interfaces resolvconf will not include those addresses in the "
"dynamically generated resolver configuration file. Without those addresses "
"you may have trouble resolving domain names. A TEMPORARY solution is to "
"append the whole original resolver configuration file to the end of the "
"dynamically generated file. This will be done if there is a symbolic link "
"from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/"
"original. If you agree then this symbolic link will be created, provided "
"that no /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail already exists."
