                     MAINTAINER NOTES
                     for resolvconf

TODO
----
When changing conffiles, update the license reference to refer to
/usr/share/doc/resolvconf/copyright and update jdthood's e-mail address.

A lintian warning about the man pages goes away when the
man-db package is upgraded to >= 2.5.3-1.

As Ian Jackson says (http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2008/03/msg00091.html)
> OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET SOMETHING DONE AROUND HERE?
