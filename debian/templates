Template: resolvconf/linkify-resolvconf
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
 This package contains the infrastructure required for dynamic updating of
 the resolver configuration file. Part of the necessary infrastructure is
 a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf.
 If you agree then this link will be created. The existing /etc/resolv.conf
 file will be preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original; it will
 be restored if this package is removed.
 .
 If you wish to prevent future installations from recreating the symbolic
 link then you can run dpkg-reconfigure later to withdraw your agreement.
 .
 If you do not agree then the necessary symbolic link will not be created
 and consequently your resolver configuration file will not be dynamically
 updated. In order to activate dynamic updating you will have to configure
 resolvconf manually following the straightforward instructions in the
 README file. If you choose not to configure resolvconf at all then you
 should remove the package because its presence causes some programs to
 deviate from their default behavior.
 .
 However you decide, you should read the README file.

Template: resolvconf/downup-interfaces
Type: note
_Description: Remember to reconfigure network interfaces
 Once resolvconf is installed, interface configurers supply nameserver
 information to it (which it then makes available to the C Library resolver
 and to DNS caches). However, they do this only when they bring up interfaces.
 Therefore for resolvconf's nameserver information to be up to date after
 initial installation it is necessary to reconfigure interfaces --
 that is, to take them down and then to bring them up again -- and to restart
 DNS caches.

Template: resolvconf/link-tail-to-original
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
 If your original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)
 contains nameserver addresses then those addresses should be listed on
 "dns-nameservers" lines in /etc/network/interfaces as described in the
 README. Until you have modified /etc/network/interfaces and reconfigured
 the affected interfaces resolvconf will not include those addresses in the
 dynamically generated resolver configuration file. Without those addresses
 you may have trouble resolving domain names. A TEMPORARY solution is to
 append the whole original resolver configuration file to the end of
 the dynamically generated file. This will be done if there is a symbolic
 link from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
 /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. If you agree then this symbolic
 link will be created, provided that no /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail
 already exists.
 .
 After you have modified /etc/network/interfaces to add the required
 "dns-nameservers" lines you should point the
 /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail symbolic link to /dev/null.
