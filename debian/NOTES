                     for resolvconf

Loop dangers
------------
Remember the interesting fact that postinst runs dpkg-event.d/foo
which probably runs /sbin/resolvconf which probably runs update.d/foo.

Things one tends to forget
--------------------------
Remember to run debconf-updatepo after changing a template or po file.
